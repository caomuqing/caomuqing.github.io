**Cooperative Aerial Robots Inspection Challenge (CARIC) @ CDC 2023**

We have organized a challenge to design comprehensive and efficient solutions for multi-UAV collaborative inspection of large structures. The challeng is simulation-based and the winners will be announced at [IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)](https://cdc2023.ieeecss.org/cooperative-aerial-robots-inspection-challenge/), Singapore, December 2023. The challenge rules can be found [here](https://ntu-aris.github.io/caric/).
