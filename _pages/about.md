<img style="float: left; margin-right: 1em" src="images/caric1.gif" width="40%" height="5">
We have organized a [challenge](https://ntu-aris.github.io/caric/) to design comprehensive and efficient solutions for multi-UAV collaborative inspection of large structures. The challeng is simulation-based and the winners will be announced at [IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)](https://cdc2023.ieeecss.org/cooperative-aerial-robots-inspection-challenge/), Singapore, December 2023.

**Planning for Multiple Tethered Robots Using Topological Braids (RSS 2023)**

We have introduced a path planning algorithm for multiple tethered robot with guaranteed non-entanglement, leveraging the theory of topological braids. The paper is accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2023. \[[Paper](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p106.html)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/igP7eaOyZuc?si=JnqFPzdO9TdRhEz0)\]\[[Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-WXg0hH5Co&t=4976s)\]\[[Code](https://github.com/caomuqing/tethered_robots_path_planning)\]

**Trajectory Planning for Multiple Tethered Unmanned Vehicles (T-RO)**

We have introduced a trajectory planning framework for multiple tethered unmanned vehicles. The framework lewverages a proposed representation of homotopy that efficiently captures the interactions among the robots, and generates trajectories in an online and decentralized manner. The paper is accepted by IEEE T-EO. \[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10106112)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/8b1RlDvQsi0?si=5a1XaOBbJUw2tFsK)\]\[[Code](https://github.com/caomuqing/neptune)\]

**Distributed Multi-Robot Sweep Coverage Control**

We have introduced a coverage control algorithm for multi-robot sweep coverage in a region with unknown and uneven workload distribution. The paper is accepted by IEEE T-SMC. \[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168201)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/nBXupDJ9x94?si=JUgQYje5BrFEth6z)\]

**Differential Dynamic Programming-Based Polynomial Trajectory Generation (RA-L)**

We have introduced a novel polynomial trajectory optimization algorithm leveraging differential dynamic programming. We have also released a solver-free implementation of the algorithm in the [package](https://github.com/ntu-caokun/DIRECT). The algorithm is verified using an UAV in indoor flight experiments. The paper is accepted by IEEE RA-L. \[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9681227)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/BM8_ABM_2VM?si=NYmO9b82DaAmkFiN)\]\[[Code](https://github.com/ntu-caokun/DIRECT)\]
