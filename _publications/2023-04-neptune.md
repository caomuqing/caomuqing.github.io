Despite recent progress in trajectory planning for multiple robots and a single tethered robot, trajectory planning for multiple tethered robots to reach their individual targets without entanglements remains a challenging problem. In this article, a complete approach is presented to address this problem. First, a multirobot tether-aware representation of homotopy is proposed to efficiently evaluate the feasibility and safety of a potential path in terms of 1) the cable length required to reach a target following the path, and 2) the risk of entanglements with the cables of other robots. Then the proposed representation is applied in a decentralized and online planning framework, which includes a graph-based kinodynamic trajectory finder and an optimization-based trajectory refinement, to generate entanglement-free, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories. The efficiency of the proposed homotopy representation is compared against the existing single and multiple tethered robot planning approaches. Simulations with up to eight UAVs show the effectiveness of the approach in entanglement prevention and its real-time capabilities. Flight experiments using three tethered UAVs verify the practicality of the presented approach. The software implementation is publicly available online. \[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10106112)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/8b1RlDvQsi0?si=5a1XaOBbJUw2tFsK)\]\[[Code](https://github.com/caomuqing/neptune)\]
