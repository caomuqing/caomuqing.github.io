We introduced a novel polynomial trajectory optimization algorithm leveraging differential dynamic programming. We have also released a solver-free implementation of the algorithm in the package. The algorithm is verified using an UAV in indoor flight experiments. \[[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9681227)\]\[[Video](https://youtu.be/BM8_ABM_2VM?si=NYgQYje5BrFEth6z)\]\[[Code](https://github.com/ntu-caokun/DIRECT)\]
