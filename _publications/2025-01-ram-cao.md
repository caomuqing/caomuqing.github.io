We have organized a simulation-based challenge to design efficient solutions for multi-UAV collaborative inspection of large structures. The challenge has been successfully organized at IROS 2024 and CDC 2023. \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06566)\]\[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u5hj2oZ-VY)\]\[[Challenge Rules](https://ntu-aris.github.io/caric/)\]
