AirCrab is a hybrid aerial ground manipulator (HAGM) with an active wheel and a 3-DoF manipulator. AirCrab leverages a single point of contact with the ground to reduce position drift and improve manipulation accuracy. \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15805)\]\[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1n-IiIt400)\]
